# WebScrapper


This code utilizes Puppeteer, a Node library for controlling headless Chrome/Chromium, to scrape specific elements from a webpage.
It navigates to a given URL, selects and extracts the image URL and title of two articles from the webpage using XPath selectors, and logs the extracted data for both articles.
The script demonstrates how to use Puppeteer to automate web scraping tasks, accessing specific elements by their XPath and retrieving desired content from those elements on the provided website 'https://www.theblock.co/' before closing the browser instance.



## npm install puppeteer


## node scrape.js
